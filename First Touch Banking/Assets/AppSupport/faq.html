<li> How Do I Start Using FIRST Touch Banking?  </li>

<p> 
		The FIRST Touch Banking services can be activated by visiting your respective branch for performing biometric verification. Without activation of services through biometric verification registration cannot be completed on application.
		
		After activation of FIRST Touch Banking service through biometric verification, registration is a self-service process available to you on the FIRST Touch Banking application. You just need to download the application from the Android/IOS store and follow the registration process by taping on the “Sign UP” option.
		
		
		During the Registration process you need to provide the required information that includes, CNIC Number, Registered Mobile Number, Account Number etc. and submit information for verification. In case of successful verification of your provided credentials, you will be required to input the One Time Password (OTP) sent on your registered mobile number. You need to input the same in the relevant field and confirm transaction.
		
		
		The OTP provided by you will be verified in the system. After successful verification, you shall be asked to set your password and submit the same for registration/ activation. After successful registration you will receive success notification otherwise; appropriate error message will be prompted. Now you will be able to use your FIRST Touch Banking application by using your password to login the same for next login.</p>

<li> What is OTP?</li> 

<p>
		OTP is an additional security layer for verification of customer at the time of registration of application or performing certain financial transactions. It is a random 4 character code sent through FMFB short Code '6969’ or ’FMFB' that can only be used once and is sent only to your registered mobile number in FIRST Touch Banking.  OTP can be used only once for authentication of certain transactions requiring OTP and will expire within 10 Minutes, if not used/verified due to any reason and if new OTP is generated due to any reason the previous one will expire and may not be used even if its time has not expired.</p>

<li> What is benefit of OTP? </li>

<p>OTP provides another layer of online protection for you. If your login credentials have been compromised to a fraudster, the registration process will not be completed without the correct OTP that is sent to your registered mobile number. This prevents others from accessing your FIRST Touch Banking login on their devices. In addition to restricting unauthorized login to the account it will also secure certain transactions requiring OTP as an additional layer of security to perform those transactions.</p>

<li> What is OTP Via Call? </li>
<p>
		While choosing OTP Via Call service, you will receive an automated voice call from '042 3210 6969' on your
		registered contact number that will communicate your OTP. This service will ensure 03 attempts for calling on your 
		registered number if the previous calls are not answered. OTP Via call is more efficient mean of communicating the OTP 
		to you as the success ratio for delivery of call is much higher than the SMS.</p>



		<li>What if I am not getting OTP?

		<p style="font-weight:normal;">
				There might be multiple issues if you are not receiving the OTP on your registered number:</p>
			<ul>
